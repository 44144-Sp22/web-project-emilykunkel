          <p>
            Logos for various companies and organizations I have created over the span of my career. Most were created with Adobe Illustrator.
            <br><br> Spread designs for Tower Yearbook
            Volumes 100 and 101. Tower Yearbook’s 100th Volume “Highlights” was
            created in the spirit of highlighting important memories and students
            during 2021 in the wake of the Covid-19 Pandemic. All spreads were
            created with Adobe InDesign and a style guide was created and used to
            follow the book’s established theme and elements.
            <br><br>*The 100th Edition of Tower Yearbook is recognized as the
            Yearbook Pacemaker 100 Winner, Best of Show, and Poeple's Choice by the Associate Collegiate Press (ACP).

            <br><br> Other designs are newsprint layouts and a typographical poster, both with appropriate heirarchy and information. Brand Design 1 was a rebrand
            for the Linn County Area Career and Technical Center in Brookfield, Missouri. The rebrand contained appropriate colors, composition,
            a logo creation, style guide, and merchandise. The second Brand Design 2 was created for the fictonal Kordell High School, including
            a mascot featured logo, decal, and sport and performing art uniform design.
